# Joey's Starters

This is just a collection of files to help me get started with either setting up a new repo or customizing a Linux installation to suit my needs. Obviously, these files are meant to be a jumping off point just to get me started and I have omitted any files that would contain sensitive data.

Still, I find these useful to keep around and maybe there is something in here for you as well?
